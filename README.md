Dotfiles containing some of my favorite configurations, theme and customizations for shells and other things

## Installation
You can try these configurations simply executing this in your shell: (require `curl`)

```sh
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alt-Jandro/Dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```
